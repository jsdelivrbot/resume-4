\section{Co-op Work Experience}

\entry{Video Codec and Hardware Programmer}
Magnum Semiconductor,
May 2008 -- August 2008 and January 2009 -- April 2009
\paragraph
My main project was the development of
a reference encoder for the VC-1 video codec standard
which was designed to exactly match the output of the hardware encoder.
I assisted in correcting the bugs that were revealed by mismatches
on test video streams.

\entry{3D Graphics Programmer}
Side Effects Software,
January 2007 -- April 2007 and September 2007 -- December 2007
\paragraph
My main contribution to the Houdini software was
major revisions to the algorithms for
boolean operations on arbitrary surface geometry,
which improved the numerical stability and
handling of boundary cases.

\entry{Maintenance Programmer}
Research In Motion,
January 2006 -- April 2006
\paragraph
As a member of the Customer Response Team,
I was responsible for fixing bugs in the BlackBerry Enterprise Server
software and its administrative interface.
