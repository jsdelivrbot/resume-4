\section{Project Leadership Experience}

\entry{Route Optimization Team Lead,
Transit Labs,
2014/06 -- 2016/05}
\paragraph{
I took ownership of the route optimization research prototype,
and turned it into a complete software package,
which continues to serve as the foundation of the RideCo product.
This included the creation of a test suite,
design of APIs to interface with other components,
and packaging for cloud deployment.
I was also responsible for
the oversight and mentoring of the optimization team,
contributions to the overall system architecture,
and leadership in planning activities relating to optimization features.
}

\entry{Course Support for Real-\kern -1.0ptTime Programming,
University of Waterloo,
2010/09 -- 2012/08}
\paragraph{
In 2009, the OS kernel assignments for the infamous ``trains'' course
that I took as an undergraduate moved from x86 to an ARM architecture.
Beyond my TA duties, I took charge of writing the new material
required to update the neglected course resources,
which included replacing legacy code.
}

\entry{Video Codec Programmer Intern,
Magnum Semiconductor,
2008/05--08, 2009/01--04
}
\paragraph{
Using the official specification and little else,
I was the sole developer of a software video encoder for the
VC-1 codec.
Its purpose was to provide a bit-exact reference output
for the encoder being developed by the hardware team.
Working together, we discovered and resolved a critical defect in
their encoder.
}

\entry{3D Graphics Programmer Intern,
SideFX,
2007/01--04, 2007/09--12
}
\paragraph{
I was given free reign to tackle the unreliability plaguing the
tool for performing boolean operations on arbitrary surface geometry.
After a careful analysis of the existing algorithms,
I devised and implemented extensive revisions which greatly improved
numerical stability and the handling of boundary cases.
